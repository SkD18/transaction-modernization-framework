# Transaction-Modernization-Framework

A reference implementation of a modern payments hub designed for banks and fintech organizations.  
This project models how large financial institutions can process real time and high-value payments using ISO 20022 standards, microservices-style components, and event-driven workflows.

---

## 1. Overview

This repository demonstrates core building blocks of a next-generation payment system. It includes:

- Real time payment flows (RTP / FedNow style)  
- High-value payment and wire processing  
- ISO 20022 style parsing and message construction  
- Multi-rail routing and orchestration  
- Rules, validation, and sanctions-style checks  
- Ledger posting and settlement models  
- Kafka-like event integration points  
- Utility modules for fees, limits, risk scoring, configuration, and more  

---

## 2. Architecture Summary

The design follows these principles:

- **Modular, domain-driven structure** with clearly separated packages  
- **Rail-specific services** for RTP and Zelle style flows  
- **Event-friendly design** supporting stream processing and asynchronous flows  
- **ISO 20022 compliant components** for structured, data-rich messaging  
- **Extensible architecture** allowing for additional rails, clearing networks, or custom business logic  

Architecture diagrams are located in the `diagrams` directory.

## 3. Key Components

### Core Processing

**PaymentEngine** — Processes payment requests, applies business rules, and determines success or failure.  
**PaymentOrchestrator** — Coordinates payment routing and execution logic across different payment rails.

### ISO 20022 Helpers

**Pacs008Parser** — Parses simplified ISO 20022 XML messages to extract fields like `EndToEndId`.  
**Pacs002Builder** — Builds basic acknowledgment messages for payment status updates.

### RTP and Zelle Services

**RtpLimitService**, **RtpFeeCalculator** — Implements logic for payment limits and fee calculations.  
**ZelleEnrollmentService**, **ZelleAliasValidator**, **ZelleLimitService** — Handles alias verification, account enrollment logic, and daily limit enforcement.

### Risk, Security, and Rules

**FraudDetectionEngine** — Basic rule-based fraud detection logic.  
**VelocityCheckService** — Monitors transaction velocity and raises alerts when thresholds are exceeded.  
**FeeRuleEngine**, **CutoffTimeEvaluator**, **CountryRiskScorer** — Example modules for fee policies, cut-off time checks, and country-based risk scoring.

## 4. Use Cases

This repository can be used for a wide range of learning, demonstration, and engineering scenarios, including:

- **Learning payment hub design fundamentals** such as orchestration, routing, and rule evaluation  
- **Teaching banking and ISO 20022 messaging concepts** with hands-on Java examples  
- **Demonstrating payment system architecture** during technical interviews or architecture reviews  
- **Prototyping new payment rails or clearing systems** using modular and extensible components  
- **Supporting research or EB-1A documentation** by showcasing technical design and implementation work  
- **Showcasing real-world financial technology engineering skills** for career, portfolio, or academic use  

---

## 5. Roadmap & Future Enhancements

Planned improvements and future extensions include:

- **Spring Boot wrappers** to expose RESTful APIs for payment initiation and status retrieval  
- **Real Kafka producers and consumers** to simulate event-driven clearing and settlement  
- **Expanded ISO 20022 coverage** including additional message types such as pacs, pain, and camt series  
- **Full end-to-end payment flow simulations** covering initiation, validation, routing, posting, settlement, and notifications  
- **Comprehensive unit and integration tests** for reliability and regression coverage  
- **Enhanced logging, monitoring, and error-handling frameworks** for production-grade observability
